I am Shane, and I call myself a serial hobbyist. This is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and my accomplishments.

My background is extremely diverse â€“ I am passionate about social growth, but I also have experience with programming, management, and journaling.

I currently have over 3 million followers across Tiktok, Instagram, and Youtube. 

Feel free to [contact me](mailto: sfanxm@gmail.com) for business and sponsorship opportunities or for potential collaborations.

## My Background
I was born in Shanghai, China and lived there for almost 10 years. Since 2011, I've lived in California.

I have a non-traditional education background: I graduated high school at 15 ranked #1 in my class, graduated college at 16 with a 4.00 and three associate degrees, and now receiving my Bachelor's degree from UC Berkeley at 18. During my higher education, I've studied and concentrated in English, electrical engineering & computer science, japanese, entrepreneurship, and art expression.

I have founded three startups and completed countless projects (see more under [Portfolio](/portfolio/)). I consider myself highly motivated and find picking up new hobbies really fun.

I have also cofounded and wrote the syllabus for UC Berkeley's CS198-73, a 3-unit decal course titled "Cloud Computing and SaaS," of which hosts about 130 students a semester. I taught the course as one of the lead instructors and had very positive ratings from my students.

### Social Media:

I am currently most interested in growth hacking and have had rapid successes in my social experiments. I started off my journey by posting to Reddit, averaging 15k upvotes per post as well as hitting #1 of r/all (Reddit's most popular post). Then, I pivoted to Tiktok, gaining 1 million followers in less than two months on my [@shanexm](https://www.tiktok.com/@shanexm) account. My second account [@shanefanx](https://www.tiktok.com/@shanefanx) on Tiktok grew from 0 to 350k followers in less than 48hrs of account creation by doing the "48hr challenge," making it one of the quickest non-celebrity account growths in all of Tiktok history.


### Research:

Although I don't have an extensive research background, I've done brief research on COVID-19 at Harvard University's Center for Geographic Analysis using GDELT data, sentimental analysis, and a little bit of unsupervised machine learning.

I do so many random things, and below are just *some* of the things I did that I can think of right now.


### Sports:

When I was 15, I ran CCCAA Division Varsity Cross Country for Fullerton College. I also did boxing at FC and had fun sparring people who were like 10 years older than me. Besides boxing, I also did a bit of Chinese Martial Arts. 

When I was 16, I joined the rock climbing club at UC Berkeley and got belay certified. In the same year, I got my open water scuba diving certification and dived at Monterey's San Carlos Beach with the Cal scuba diving club. And when I was 17, I joined Cal Dragon Boat where we paddled on outrigger canoes & dragon boats in the Berkeley Marina and made many memories as well as many friends.

### Music:

In high school, I marched on trumpet with the Ayala Marching Band where we placed 2nd in California. After high school, I played with my college's symphony orchestra as the first chair trumpet player and also my college's jazz big band. A year later at UC Berkeley, I played with the wind ensemble and performed once before school turned online during the coronavirus pandemic.

Besides trumpet, I self studied piano and got myself an invitation to perform a solo at the Lincoln Center in New York City, of which I went and performed in front of hundreds. I also play a tiny bit of the drum set, violin, marimba, vibraphone, bells, trombone, baritone, tuba, hulusi flute, and the Chinese erhu.

By having a good ear, I can play songs after listening to it once, but due to having an underdeveloped music theory background, I sometimes jumble up chords when improvising lmao.


### Film

I don't consider myself decent at film yet, but it's currently one of my most passionate interests. When I was younger, I made stop motion Lego films and posted them on Youtube. However, Youtube banned my channel, and I unfortunately didn't have my videos backed up on my devices to save space.

I picked up videography again at UC Berkeley. I was a postproduction editor for CalTV, and there I learned all the editing mechanics I needed on multiple editing softwares. I'm currently trying to make skits for Tiktok and Youtube, but I'm definitely mostly still learning as I'm going.

### Art

I like sketching and I also like making filters and lenses for Instagram and Snapchat!
